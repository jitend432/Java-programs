Spring Boot annotations are used to simplify the configuration and development of Spring applications. Here is a list of some key Spring Boot annotations and their purposes:

Core Annotations
@SpringBootApplication

This is a convenience annotation that combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration, and @ComponentScan. It is used to mark the main class of a Spring Boot application.
@Configuration

Indicates that a class can be used by the Spring IoC container as a source of bean definitions.
@Bean

Used to indicate that a method produces a bean to be managed by the Spring container.
@ComponentScan

Configures component scanning directives for use with @Configuration classes. It tells Spring to scan the package and its sub-packages for Spring components.
@EnableAutoConfiguration

Enables Spring Boot’s auto-configuration mechanism, which attempts to automatically configure your Spring application based on the jar dependencies you have added.
Stereotype Annotations
@Component

Indicates that an annotated class is a "component". Such classes are considered as candidates for auto-detection when using annotation-based configuration and classpath scanning.
@Service

Specialization of @Component, indicating that an annotated class is a "service". This annotation is a general-purpose stereotype and does not provide additional behavior over @Component.
@Repository

Specialization of @Component, indicating that an annotated class is a "repository" (i.e., a Data Access Object or DAO).
@Controller

Specialization of @Component, indicating that an annotated class is a "controller" (i.e., a web controller).
@RestController

A convenience annotation that is itself annotated with @Controller and @ResponseBody. It is used to create RESTful web services using Spring MVC.
Web and REST Annotations
@RequestMapping

Used to map web requests to specific handler classes and/or handler methods.
@GetMapping, @PostMapping, @PutMapping, @DeleteMapping, @PatchMapping

Specialized versions of @RequestMapping for handling HTTP GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests, respectively.
@PathVariable

Used to bind method parameters to URI template variables.
@RequestParam

Used to bind method parameters to web request parameters.
@RequestBody

Indicates that a method parameter should be bound to the body of the web request.
@ResponseBody

Indicates that the return value of a method should be bound to the web response body.
Configuration and Dependency Injection Annotations
@Autowired

Marks a constructor, field, setter method, or config method to be autowired by Spring’s dependency injection facilities.
@Qualifier

Used to specify which bean should be autowired when multiple beans of the same type exist.
@Value

Used to inject property values into Spring-managed beans.
@PropertySource

Used to declare a set of properties to be loaded and used in Spring’s Environment.
Conditional Annotations
@Conditional

Allows bean registration only when certain conditions are met.
@ConditionalOnProperty

Registers a bean only if a specified property has a specified value.
@ConditionalOnClass

Registers a bean only if a specified class is present on the classpath.
@ConditionalOnMissingBean

Registers a bean only if a specified bean is not already present.
Security Annotations
@Secured

Used to define security constraints on methods.
@PreAuthorize, @PostAuthorize

Used to define security constraints with more complex conditions.
@EnableWebSecurity

Enables Spring Security's web security support and provides the Spring MVC integration.
Testing Annotations
@SpringBootTest

Used to create an application context for integration tests.
@MockBean

Used to add mock beans to the Spring application context.
@WebMvcTest

Used for testing Spring MVC controllers.
@DataJpaTest

Used for testing JPA repositories.
Asynchronous and Scheduling Annotations
@EnableAsync

Enables Spring’s asynchronous method execution capability.
@Async

Indicates that a method should be executed asynchronously.
@EnableScheduling

Enables Spring’s scheduled task execution capability.
@Scheduled

Marks a method to be scheduled and executed at fixed intervals.
This is not an exhaustive list but covers the most commonly used annotations in Spring Boot. Each of these annotations simplifies various aspects of application development, making it easier to write, configure, and test Spring Boot applications.
